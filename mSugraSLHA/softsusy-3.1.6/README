QUICK INSTALLATION AND RUN TEST
-------------------------------

Download the gzipped tarball, from the SOFTSUSY homepage 
http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/ for instance softsusy-3.0.tar.gz. Then, type
(on a linux box)

> tar -xvzf softsusy-3.0.tar.gz
> cd softsusy-3.0
> ./configure
> make

which should compile the code. The following command runs a test program which
should produce the same output as is contained in the file outputTest:

> ./softsusy.x


INTRODUCTION
------------

The most recent version of SOFTSUSY and full documentation can be obtained
from: http://projects.hepforge.org/softsusy/

This code provides a SUSY spectrum in the MSSM with or without R-parity
consistent with input low energy data, and a user supplied high energy
constraint (eg minmal SUGRA). It is written in C++ with an emphasis on easy
generalisability. Full three-family couplings and renormalisation group
equations are employed, as well as one-loop finite corrections a la Bagger,
Matchev, Pierce and Zhang. It can be used in conjunction with other programs
for many different particle physics calculations. 

If you use SOFTSUSY to write a paper, please cite B.C. Allanach,
Comp. Phys. Comm. 143 (2002) 305, hep-ph/0104145, which is the SOFTSUSY
manual. If you use the R-parity violating aspects, please cite
B.C. Allanach and M.A. Bernhardt, Comp. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 232,
arXiv:0903.1805 [hep-ph]. 
The manuals on the electronic hep-ph/ archive will be updated with the most
recent version.
