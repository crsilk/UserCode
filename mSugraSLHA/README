This directory contains an overview of how to generate
the SLHA files needed for an mSugra scan.

The construction of the SLHA files requires two programs:
SoftSusy and SUSYHITS.

It does not make sense to rewrite these programs in CMSSW,
so build them as they are:

tar xzf softsusy-3.1.6.tgz
cd softsusy-3.1.6
./configure
make
cd ..
(one output is an executable named "softpoint.x")

cd src
make
cd ..
(output is an executable named "run")

From the "test" directory, you can do a scan (or a 
single point with a suitable choice of parameters).
Modify make_sugra_slha.py accordingly.

cd test
cp ../softsusy-3.1.6/softpoint.x .
cp ../src/run .
python make_msugra_slha.py

Output will be files with names like:
msugra_200_200_10_0_1.slha

Modify the obvious places in lesHouchesInput
to change tanb, A0, or sign(mu).
