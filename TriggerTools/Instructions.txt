compareRatesPrescales.py:
  Description: Creates a twiki table for the rates and prescales for all paths
  from two other twiki tables. It is meant to be used to compare predicted 
  prescales and rates to the actual prescales
  and rates.

  To Run: 
  
  cvs co UserCode/crsilk/TriggerTools/compareRatesPrescales.py
  scram b
  ./compareRatesPrescales.py predictedFile.twiki actualFile.twiki
  

makeConfigs.py:
  Description: Makes the configuration files to be run with ./OHLTRateEff given
  a menu and a list of datasets (other options are available type: 
  ./makeConfigs -h to see)

  To Run:

  cvs co UserCode/crsilk/TriggerTools/makeConfigs.py
  cvs co UserCode/crsilk/TriggerTools/hltmenu_MENU_RUNNUMBER_DS_DATASET.cfg.template
  cvs co UserCode/crsilk/TriggerTools/Datasets.list
  scram b 

  you must then run Johnathan's magic to get the file 
  hltmenu_extractedhltmenu.cfg in the directory you are going to run this(will 
  not work without this). You can either give the script a path to a directory 
  of nTuples as an argument or a txt file many nTuple paths (note if you want
  to run with the -f option(full table) you must include a minimum bias dataset
  path). I have included an example txt file called paths.txt.Here are three
  examples on how to run:
    
    Example 1:
    ./makeConfigs.py paths.txt -m 3.5e30 -f
    This will make the full table cfg as well as all the individual dataset 
    cfgs

    Example 2:
    ./makeConfigs.py paths.txt -m 3.5e30 -l 3.0
    This will make all the individual dataset cfgs but not full table. This 
    will also give you a lumi scale factor of 3.0 

    Example 3:
    ./makeConfigs.py dcap://cmsdca.fnal.gov:24136/pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/cms/WAX/resilient/lucieg/Commish2010/r142662__EGMonitor_Run2010A-v1__20100813_1424/ -m 3.5e30
    this will create a cfg only for the EGMonitor dataset
