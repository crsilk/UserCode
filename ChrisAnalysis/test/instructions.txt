When looking through my code you will notice that there are large blocks of commented code. This
is the code that I used to make the plots of the different delta R and delta Pt criteria that 
defined a 'matched' photon, I left it in there in case you wanted to see how I got the plots 
that are in the directory
/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/test. I will first tell
you where all the code that I wrote is.


All of my code that I have written for chrisAnalysis is contained in 4 different files:

/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/bin/chrisAnalysis.cc
This contains the main of the program. Most of the code was not actually written by me but was
taken from TemplateAnalysis which is in the directory below ChrisAnalysis. When I made the 
plots in my test directory I used this to write the original histograms.

/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/src/ChrisHistograms.cc
This contains the declarations of all the histograms that appear in the outputted root file.

/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/src/ChrisAnalysis.cc
Contains the bulk of the code. Almost all of it is located in the function analyze, where is
goes through all the pfParticles in the event picks picks out which are what kind of particles
and how pt is due to them. Then it fills the histograms that are then in the root file

/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/CommonTools/interface/FWLiteAnalyzer.h
I did not want to have to modify the file but if I didn't I would have had to rewrite a lot of
the existing code. All it really contains is class variables and a few class functions.


How to Run:
This is CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2,  and the analyzer is based off of TemplateAnalysis which is located
a directory below in /uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/TemplateAnalysis

Obviously to compile you must do:
scram b -j 4
but this must be done with the altered FWLiteAnalyzer.h code mentioned above.

to run the program go to the directory 
/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/test
and type:
chrisAnalysis Chris_cfg.py
This will create an output file PFAnalysis_SingleGammaPt.root, which contains all the histograms 
that are created by the program. Chris_cfg.py takes a data file located in
/uscms_data/d2/csilkw2/CMSSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/Configuration/Generator/test. However if you want it
to take a different file it is pretty straight forward to change.
