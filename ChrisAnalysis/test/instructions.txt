Installation: Set up a CMSSW area check out the necessary packages and compile

   cmsrel CMMSW_3_7_0_patch2
   cd CMMSW_3_7_0_patch2/src/
   cvs co UserCode/crsilk/ChrisAnalysis/
   cvs co -r  Matt_dxyTempFix_290710 -d   AnalysisDataFormats/PFAnalyses UserCode/PFAnalyses/AnalysisDataFormats/PFAnalyses      
   cvs co -r  Florian_5Aug2010-2 -d   PFAnalyses/CommonTools   UserCode/PFAnalyses/CommonTools   
   cvs co -r  Colin_37X_June18 -d   PFAnalyses/RootTools  UserCode/PFAnalyses/RootTools                          
   mv UserCode/crsilk/ChrisAnalysis/ PFAnalyses/
   rm -r UserCode/
   scram b -j 4

How to run: Go into the ChriAnalysis/test directory alter Chris_cfg.py and run

   cd PFAnalyses/ChrisAnalysis/test/
   cmsenv

   Now you have to edit the Chris_cfg.py file so that it takes as a source file one that actually exists. Go down to the file
  'file:$CMSSW_BASE/src/Configuration/Generator/test/SingleGammaPt35_cfi_py_GEN_SIM_DIGI_L1_DIGI2RAW_RAW2DIGI_RECO.root
   and change it to your favorite SingleGammaPt gun. Right now that is all that will work and although Pt = 35 isn't hard
   coded in there I haven't tested it for anything else so it might give strange results. Now run it:
  
   chrisAnalysis Chris_cfg.py

   This will create an output .root file PFAnalysis_SingleGamma.root, which contains a bunch of histograms.

Looking at the results:

   root -l PFAnalysis_SingleGamma.root
   [root] TBrowser b

   And then look at the use the browser to just click on the histograms. Or to get much nicer plots with the various macros
   located in the folder ChrisAnalysis/test/macros/. Move the macro you want to you use into the test area and run

   root -l
   [root] .x (macro name)
